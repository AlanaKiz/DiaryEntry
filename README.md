# 📘 My Diary Web App

A simple and clean **personal diary web page** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project allows users to write, save, view, and clear diary entries **based on date**, with data stored locally in the browser.


## ✨ Features

- 📅 Select a date and write diary entries  
- 💾 Save entries using browser `localStorage`  
- 🔄 Automatically loads saved entries  
- 🗑️ Clear / delete entry for a selected date  
- 🎨 Clean blue-themed user interface  
- ⚡ No backend required (pure frontend project)


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the web page  
- **CSS** – Styling and blue-themed layout  
- **JavaScript** – Logic, DOM manipulation, and localStorage handling  


## 📂 Project Structure

│── index.html   # Main HTML file

## 🚀 How It Works

- The user selects a date using the date picker.
- Diary text is written in the textarea.
- Clicking **Save Entry** stores the entry under the selected date.
- Entries are saved in the browser using `localStorage`.
- When a date is selected again, its entry is automatically loaded.
- Clicking **Clear Entry** deletes the entry for that date.

## 📌 Purpose of This Project

This project was built **for learning purposes**, to understand:
- Basic web page structure
- Separation of concerns (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Using `localStorage` for data persistence

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- Add search functionality  
- Add dark mode  
- Export diary entries  
- Improve mobile responsiveness
